//i dont know javascript yet, though i will use this file for DOM manipulation to refresh pages without actually reloading
//and for functionality of the page, like for taking user-inputs (forms), dragging window-popups etc
//no backend stuff for now, no node.js, just frontend stuff for the page
//myb i will make a reloading screen before it accesses index.html, like a animated loading icon and then index.html
//i might need JS for that, it will be like 'connecting to the luxuria archive, executing thema' where the thema
//is the website ig.
console.log('Hello');
